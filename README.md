This repository holds all code used in the creation of my thesis titled: "Assessing the Benefits of Using Cost-Sensitive Machine Learning Methods in Fraud Detection: An Auditor-Centric Approach."
Additionally, the cleaned datasets are added to allow for recreation of the results.

The data is retrieved from WRDS, and direct links to the specific databases can be found in the references of the thesis.

In order to run the analysis .rmd files, make sure you download both the rmd and the data file as a whole. If you save both in the same folder, the .rmd should run without any changes.

The original data could not be added to this repository as the size of the files is too large. The prepared datasets are added in the zip file.

Additionally, I have added the main analysis in the file analysis_correct.rmd and the feature importance trend analysis in feature_importance_trend.rmd
